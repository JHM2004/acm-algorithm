描述

You are given three arrays a, b and c. Initially, array a consists of n elements, arrays b and c are empty.

You are performing the following algorithm that consists of two steps:

Step 1: while a is not empty, you take the last element from a and move it in the middle of array b. If b currently has odd length, you can choose: place the element from a to the left or to the right of the middle element of b. As a result, a becomes empty and b consists of n elements.
Step 2: while b is not empty, you take the middle element from b and move it to the end of array c. If b currently has even length, you can choose which of two middle elements to take. As a result, b becomes empty and c now consists of n elements.
Refer to the Note section for examples.
Can you make array c sorted in non-decreasing order?

输入描述

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤2⋅10 
4
 ) — the number of test cases. Next t cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains the single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅10 
5
 ) — the length of array a.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a

输出描述

For each test, print YES (case-insensitive), if you can make array c sorted in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, print NO (case-insensitive).

In the first test case, we can do the following for a=[3,1,5,3]:

Step 1:

a	[3,1,5,3]	⇒	[3,1,5]	⇒	[3,1]	⇒	[3]	⇒	[]
b	[]		[ 
3
​
 ]		[3, 
5
​
 ]		[3, 
1
​
 ,5]		[3, 
3
​
 ,1,5]
Step 2:

b	[3,3, 
1
​
 ,5]	⇒	[3, 
3
​
 ,5]	⇒	[ 
3
​
 ,5]	⇒	[ 
5
​
 ]	⇒	[]
c	[]		[1]		[1,3]		[1,3,3]		[1,3,3,5]
As a result, array c=[1,3,3,5] and it's sorted.
