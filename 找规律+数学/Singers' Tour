描述

n towns are arranged in a circle sequentially. The towns are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. In the i-th town, there lives a singer with a repertoire of a 
i
​
  minutes for each i∈[1,n].

Each singer visited all n towns in clockwise order, starting with the town he lives in, and gave exactly one concert in each town. In addition, in each town, the i-th singer got inspired and came up with a song that lasts a 
i
​
  minutes. The song was added to his repertoire so that he could perform it in the rest of the cities.

Hence, for the i-th singer, the concert in the i-th town will last a 
i
​
  minutes, in the (i+1)-th town the concert will last 2⋅a 
i
​
  minutes, ..., in the ((i+k)modn+1)-th town the duration of the concert will be (k+2)⋅a 
i
​
 , ..., in the town ((i+n−2)modn+1) — n⋅a 
i
​
  minutes.

You are given an array of b integer numbers, where b 
i
​
  is the total duration of concerts in the i-th town. Reconstruct any correct sequence of positive integers a or say that it is impossible.

输入描述

The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤10 
3
 ) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤4⋅10 
4
 ) — the number of cities. The second line contains n integers b 
1
​
 ,b 
2
​
 ,…,b 
n
​
  (1≤b 
i
​
 ≤10 
9
 ) — the total duration of concerts in i-th city.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10 
5
 .

输出描述

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

If there is no suitable sequence a, print NO. Otherwise, on the first line print YES, on the next line print the sequence a 
1
​
 ,a 
2
​
 ,…,a 
n
​
  of n integers, where a 
i
​
  (1≤a 
i
​
 ≤10 
9
 ) is the initial duration of repertoire of the i-th singer. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Let's consider the 1-st test case of the example:

the 1-st singer in the 1-st city will give a concert for 3 minutes, in the 2-nd — for 6 minutes, in the 3-rd — for 9 minutes;
the 2-nd singer in the 1-st city will give a concert for 3 minutes, in the 2-nd — for 1 minute, in the 3-rd - for 2 minutes;
the 3-rd singer in the 1-st city will give a concert for 6 minutes, in the 2-nd — for 9 minutes, in the 3-rd — for 3 minutes.
